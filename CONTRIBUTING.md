# Contributing to Our GitHub

This page is your one-stop shop for uncovering how to contribute to our Github!

## We Want Your Help!

No, really, we do! Please come and participate in our community and lets do science together! Depending on your level of interaction with the Land Processes Data Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) and the LP DAAC GitHub, visitors to the site can be described as: 
- A **community member**: anyone in the open science community who visits a LP DAAC site, utilizes LP DAAC online tools, or attends a LP DAAC event.
- A **participant**: anyone who posts a comment or poses a question in the *GitHub Discussion Space*, reports a site bug or requests a new resource in *GitHub Issues*, or attends a LP DAAC event and utilizes any virtual chat features during that event. 
- A **contributor**: anyone who forks this GitHub repository and submits pull requests to make additions or changes to the posted content.

Everyone reading this page is a community member, and we hope everyone will post comments and join discussions as a participant. Contributors are welcome, particularly to help find and point to other open science resources. 

## Ways to Contribute to the  GitHub
There are two main ways to contribute to the LP DAAC GitHub.  
- **Suggest a change, addition, or deletion to what is already on the GitHub using [Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues).** Issues can be about any LP DAAC plans, timelines, and content. 
     - Before submitting a new [issue](https://github.com/nasa/LPDAAC-Data-Resources/issues), check to make sure [a similar issue isn't already open](https://github.com/nasa/LPDAAC-Data-Resources/issues). If one is, contribute to that issue thread with your feedback.
     - When submitting a bug report, please try to provide as much detail as possible, i.e. a screenshot or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that demonstrates the problem, the technology you are using, and any relevant links. 
     - Issues labeled :sparkles:[`help wanted`](https://github.com/nasa/LPDAAC-Data-Resources/labels/help%20wanted):sparkles: make it easy for you to find ways you can contribute today. 
- **Become a contributor!** [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and [make commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) to add resources and additional materials. Here are some ways you can contribute:
     - by reporting bugs
     - by suggesting new features
     - by translating content to a new language
     - by writing or editing documentation
     - by writing specifications
     - by writing code and documentation (**no pull request is too small**: fix typos, add code comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)
     - by closing [issues](https://github.com/nasa/LPDAAC-Data-Resources/issues)

In the spirit of open source software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project!
                                                               
## New to GitHub? Start here!
You can [sign up for GitHub here](https://github.com/)! The NASA Transform to Open Science Team has made a short video demonstrating how to make an easy pull request [here](https://youtu.be/PHoScPeMWHI).

For a more in-depth start, we suggest *[Getting Started with Git and GitHub: The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)* and *[The Beginners Guide to Git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)*. We've summarized some of the most important points below.

### Making a Change

Once you've identified something you'd like to help with you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    [This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. Fork this repository to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date]( https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create separate branches for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a pull request.

    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!  
    
    N.B. you don't have to be ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.

## Development Model

For accepting new contributions, TOPS uses the [forking workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). As the first step of your contribution, you'll want to fork this repository, make a local clone of it, add your contribution, and then create a pull request back to the LP DAAC repository.  

All documentation should be written using Markdown and Github Markdown-supported HTML.
